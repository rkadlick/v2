Worked in a team to create a data processing program working with flight simulation program, FlightGear. The project is created in Python, using matplotlib, numpys, scipy, etc., and intended for real world use.

The objective being to extract data from flight landing attempts, visual the flight data via graphs, and to perform regression and clustering algorithms that can accurately classify what is considered a good landing compared to a baseline.
