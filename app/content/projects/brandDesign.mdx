These projects were all created by myself using a combination of Adobe InDesign, Adobe Illustrator, and Adobe Photoshop. They represent either a rebrand of a current company (Sea Turtle Conservatory and Ultra Music Festival) or a fictional company created by myself (Infinity, Timeless Grind, and Neptune's Kitchen). The pdfs are either a style guide for the company or a showcase of mockups created. Click the above buttons to view them.
