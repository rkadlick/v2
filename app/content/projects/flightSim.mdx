Worked on a team to create a data processing program working with flight simulation program, FlightGear, intended for real world use in the aviation industry. My main responsibility was to create Python programs to extract, visualize, and prepare the data.

The objective was to extract data from flight landing attempts, visualize the flight data via graphs, and to perform regression and clustering algorithms that could accurately classify what is considered a good landing compared to a baseline.
