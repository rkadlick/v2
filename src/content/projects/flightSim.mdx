The FlightGear Simulation project was a semester long project completed in my final year of graduate school at University of Massachusetts - Boston. I completed this project in a group with four other members. The goal of this project was to capture and analyze the trajectory of an aircraft landing and use this data to characterize what a successful landing was, for real world use in training and auto-landing purposes.
