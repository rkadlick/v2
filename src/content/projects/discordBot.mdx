DreamBot is a discord bot created as both a learning endeavor and to help moderate and brighten up my private Discord server. The repository is on Github and I currently have an AWS server running this bot 24/7 for my private Discord server. This bot has a variety of commands currently and is constantly being built upon. Some technologies used for this project are node.js, AWS, sqlite, and random REST APIs for certain tasks.
